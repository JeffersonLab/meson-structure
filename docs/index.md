## Welcome to the Meson Structure Project

Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will enable a revolution in our ability to study pion and kaon structure.
This documentation site provides  information about the meson structure analysis for the (EIC) 
Here you'll find guides on data access, analysis techniques, and the published results.

### Latest Updates
