# Learning Resources

This page provides a curated collection of learning materials for students and collaborators joining the Meson Structure Functions group. The resources are organized progressively, from foundational concepts to advanced reference materials.

## Getting Started with Hadron Physics

Before diving into meson structure specifically, it helps to build a solid foundation in the physics we study at Jefferson Lab and the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider.

### Jefferson Lab and Nuclear Physics

These introductory videos provide an accessible overview of the science at Jefferson Lab and the fundamental questions we're working to answer.

- [Inside the Nucleus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJM4wyCv6C4)
- [Charting the Inner Structure of the Proton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-9I0buDi4s)

### The Electron-Ion Collider

The EIC represents the next frontier for understanding hadron structure. These resources introduce the science case and the facility.

- [Introduction to Particle Detectors](https://indico.cern.ch/event/387976/attachments/1124401/1605557/daniela_l2.pdf) — CERN summer school lecture
- [Calorimetry in High Energy Physics](https://www.desy.de/~garutti/LECTURES/ParticleDetectorSS12/L10_Calorimetry.pdf) — Detailed treatment of calorimeter physics (DESY, Garutti)

## Core Physics Background

These materials provide the theoretical and experimental foundations needed to understand meson structure physics in depth.

### Textbooks and Comprehensive References

**Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics**  
*Halzen & Martin* — [PDF](http://www.ift.uni.wroc.pl/~blaschke/vorles/Halzen-Martin_Quarks-Leptons.pdf)  
This is the standard graduate-level textbook for particle physics. It covers the Standard Model, scattering theory, and the formalism underlying our measurements. Particularly useful chapters include those on deep inelastic scattering and the parton model.

**Particle Data Group (PDG) Review of Particle Physics**  
[PDG 2025 Reviews](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2025/reviews/contents_sports.html)  
The PDG is an invaluable reference for anyone in particle physics. For our work, the following sections are particularly relevant: kinematics (definitions of kinematic variables and relativistic relations), cross sections (formalism for scattering calculations), particle detectors (resolution formulas, detector response), and form factors (electromagnetic structure of hadrons).

**Introduction to Relativistic Kinematics and Scattering**  
*Xiaochao Zheng* — [PDF](./xiaochao_kinematics.pdf)  
A pedagogical introduction that builds from four-vectors to scattering cross sections, designed for students working on JLab projects.

## Meson Structure Theory and Formalism

These papers contain the theoretical framework and equations used in our analyses. They serve as essential reference material for understanding the physics behind our measurements.

### Key Theory Papers

**Pion and Kaon Structure at the Electron-Ion Collider**  
*Aguilar et al.* — [arXiv:2102.11788](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11788)  
This comprehensive review covers the theory of meson structure functions, including the formalism for Sullivan process measurements and the physics case for EIC studies. Note that this paper is theory-heavy but provides the complete mathematical framework underlying our work.

**Insights into the Emergence of Mass from Studies of Pion and Kaon Structure**  
*Arrington et al.* — [arXiv:2102.01765](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01765)  
Connects meson structure measurements to fundamental questions about mass generation in QCD. Includes discussion of both experimental approaches and theoretical predictions.

### Foundational Experimental and Phenomenology Papers

These references from the [Meson Structure Functions wiki](https://wiki.jlab.org/cuawiki/index.php/Meson_Structure_Functions) provide important background on the experimental techniques and theoretical framework.

**EIC White Paper**  
*Accardi et al.*, Eur. Phys. J. A52 (2016) no.9, 268  
The comprehensive science case for the Electron-Ion Collider, including meson structure physics. Essential reading for understanding the broader context of our measurements.

**Leading Neutron Production in e+p Collisions at HERA**  
Nucl. Phys. B 637 (2002) 3-56  
The ZEUS measurement of leading neutron electroproduction, which established the experimental technique we build upon.
