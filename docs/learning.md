## Learning steps

0. Make sure to read and know the software stack (all links and description below)
1. If you are not familiar with EIC software environment, there are 
   [centralized EIC EPIC tutorials](https://www.epic-eic.org/sc/tutorials.html). :
   Essentially you need:
   - [Setting up the environment](https://eic.github.io/tutorial-setting-up-environment/)
   - [Analysis and working with the simulation output](https://eic.github.io/tutorial-analysis/)
2. GitHub account. You should be able to contribute to this repository:
   - https://github.com/JeffersonLab/meson-structure
   
   Any account can fork and create Pull Requests (PRs) with changes. 
   But it is convenient to be in developers lists and be able to create branches
   and push changes directly. These permissions are automatically on for  
   the members [JeffersonLab](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/) org. 
   For not JeffersonLab members it is suggested to contact repository maintainers 
   to be added to the developers list.
